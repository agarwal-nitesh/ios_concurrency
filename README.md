# Concurrency in iOS using GCD :
 
 GCD - Grand Central Dispatch is a low-level C-base API that enables very simple use of task based concurrency model.


## Dispatch Queues :
 - Serial Queues
 - Concurrent Queues


### Serial Queues :
 - Create :
 
 	```
	queue = dispatch_create("com.nitesh.serialqueue", DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL)
	```
	
 - Execute :
 
 	```
	dispatch_async(queue, task)
	```


### Concurrent Queues :
 - Create :
 
 	```
	queue = dispatch_create("com.nitesh.concurrentqueue", DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)
 	```
 - Execute :
 
 	```
	dispatch_async(queue, task)
	```
	
	
### iOS default queues :
By default iOS provides 1 serial and 4 concurrent queues.
 
 - Serial queue
 	```
	dispatch_get_main_queue()
	```
	
 - Concurrent queues
 	```
	dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0)
	```
 - DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH
 - DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_LOW
 - DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND

Execution of tasks can also be done via `dispatch_group_async` . This lets you wait for concurrent tasks completion and notify concurrent tasks completion.
	
	
### ConcurrencyCheatSheet src :
`Tasks` protocol in the project uses GCD.
`TasksHighLevel` protocol uses NSOperationQueue for same task based concurrency Interface.
